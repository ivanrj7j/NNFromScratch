# Neural Network From Scratch

## Overview

This repository is a learning project where I explore how neural networks are built from scratch using Java and Python. The goal is to understand the inner workings of neural networks without relying on high-level machine learning libraries. 

## Features

- Implementation of basic neural network components.
- Support for multiple activation functions.
- Training and testing using custom datasets.
- Implementations in both Java and Python.

## Setup

### Python
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sky0walker99/NNFromScratch.git
   cd NNFromScratch
   ```
2. Run a sample script:
   ```sh
   python src/main.py
   ```

### Java
1. Ensure you have JDK installed.
2. Navigate to the Java source directory:
   ```sh
   cd src/java
   ```
3. Compile and run:
   ```sh
   javac NeuralNetwork.java
   java NeuralNetwork
   ```

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding fundamental concepts of neural networks.
- Implementing forward and backward propagation.
- Exploring different optimization techniques.
- Comparing implementations in Python and Java.
